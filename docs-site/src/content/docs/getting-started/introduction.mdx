QemuWeb is a groundbreaking project that brings full virtual machine emulation to web browsers using WebAssembly. It compiles QEMU—the industry-standard open-source emulator—to run entirely in your browser, enabling you to boot complete operating systems without any local installation.

## What is QemuWeb?

QemuWeb is a monorepo containing several packages that work together to provide a complete virtualization solution:

### The Three-Layer Architecture

1. **Main Thread (UI Layer)**
   - React application with terminal UI (xterm.js)
   - `QemuClient` API for VM control
   - AI agent integration (LangGraph)

2. **Web Worker (Execution Layer)**
   - Runs QEMU WebAssembly in an isolated thread
   - Handles VM lifecycle and I/O
   - Communicates via `postMessage` protocol

3. **Storage Layer (Persistence)**
   - Block devices backed by IndexedDB
   - Copy-on-Write overlays for efficient snapshots
   - Content-addressed storage (Atlas Store)

## Key Features

### 🚀 Zero Installation
No need to install Docker, VirtualBox, or any other software. If your browser supports WebAssembly and SharedArrayBuffer, you can run VMs.

### 💾 Persistent Storage
VMs maintain their state across browser sessions using IndexedDB. Changes are stored efficiently using Copy-on-Write, so you only store what's changed.

### 🔒 Sandboxed Security
Each VM runs in a completely isolated Web Worker. There's no access to your host filesystem, network, or other browser tabs.

### 🤖 AI Integration
Built-in support for AI agents via LangGraph and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Let AI control your virtual infrastructure!

### 🌐 Virtual Networking
Configure complex network topologies with multiple VMs, routers, and firewall rules—all running in your browser.

## Use Cases

- **Education**: Learn Linux, networking, or system administration without affecting your real system
- **Development**: Test infrastructure configurations in isolated environments
- **Security Research**: Analyze malware or suspicious files safely
- **AI Training**: Create controlled environments for training AI agents
- **Demos**: Show live Linux environments in web applications

## Browser Requirements

<Aside type="caution">
  QemuWeb requires specific browser features that need proper server configuration.
</Aside>

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| WebAssembly | Core technology for running QEMU |
| SharedArrayBuffer | Required for multi-threaded WASM |
| Cross-Origin Isolation | Headers: `COOP` and `COEP` |
| IndexedDB | For persistent storage |

See [Browser Requirements](/qemuweb/getting-started/requirements/) for detailed compatibility information.
